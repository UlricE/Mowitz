<h1>Using the File Selector</h1>

The file selector has four main parts:

<ul>
<li>the file area
<li>the directory area
<li>the format menu
<li>the button area
</ul>

<h2>The File Area</h2>
Filenames can be entered in the text box or selected from the list below
it.
Pressing Enter or Return has the same effect as clicking the OK
button (see below). Pressing Esc has the same effect as clicking
the Cancel button.

<h2>The Directory Area</h2>
Like in the file area, directories can be selected from a list.
Above the list is a menu which can be used to quickly go to ancestor
directories.

<h2>The Format Menu</h2>
The format menu allows you to choose which files are shown in the list.
Each entry represents one of the formats the application can handle.
In addition, there should always be a menu entry to display all files.

<h2>The Button Area</h2>
There are four buttons which are always there:
<ul>
<li>The <b>OK</b> button confirms the selected file and closes the
	dialog. If the filename box contains a directory name
	rather than a file, the dialog is not closed.
	Instead the directory is changed so that files can
	be selected from that directory.
<li>The <b>Cancel</b> button closes the dialog without returning a file.
<li>The <b>Find</b> button allows you to find files that are hiding
	in a directory hierarchy without navigating manually through
	the directories. The pattern can be a filename or a pattern
	such as *.html.
<li>The <b>Help</b> button displays this help.
</ul>

There may also be buttons which are shortcuts to
frequently used directories, such as your home directory.
