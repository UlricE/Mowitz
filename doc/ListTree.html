<p><hr><h2><a name="current">Current Version</a></h2>


<p>The current version is 2.0.  Source is available at
<a href=ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/widgets/ListTree-2.0.tar.gz>ftp.x.org</a>.

<p>This picture shows the formatting of the ListTree widget:

<h3><a name="fs">File Selector Demo</a></h3>
<p>A more complete (but unsupported) demo is also included with the ListTree
widget.  Using the 3D Athena widgets, this tree file selector shows more of
the potential usage of the widget:

<p><hr><h2><a name="new"><img src=new.gif align=bottom alt="[New!]">Important version 2.0 changes</a></h2>

<p>Why is this version 2.0, rather than a simple update to 1.1?

<p>Mostly because of a change in the callbacks.  Version 1.0 required the
user to free the callback return structure, ala Motif.  I didn't like to
code it that way originally, but I did.  Once I figured out that that
XtCallCallbacks didn't return to the widget until the callbacks return
(rather than asyncronously), I changed the callback code so that the user
doesn't free the return structure.

<p>The old callbacks still exist in the widget, but should now be considered
historical and unsupported.   So, go ahead and switch to the new
callbacks now, because I might remove the historical callbacks in a future
release.  If you switch now, you won't be mad when I really do take out
the old, hacky callback routines. :)  Check the
<a href="ListTreeProg.html#historical">Programmer's Documentation</a> for
more information on converting to the new methods.  It's easy!

<p>The other new features in the widget are multiple highlighting, and a
change in the operating methodology of the widget.  Single clicking on the
text of on item highlights the item, but does not open it.  Single clicking
and dragging selects multiple items.  Double clicking the text highlights
the item, unselects everything else, and opens the item.  Single clicking
on the icon opens the item.

<p><hr><h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>The ListTree Widget is small list widget capable of displaying lists of
text strings (with an optional pixmap) in a heirarchal directory list sort
of format.  Unlike all of the other freely available tree widgets that I could
find, this widget does not use widgets for each item displayed in the tree.
Instead, it is a list of text strings that contain pointers to parents and
children in the tree.  This reduces memory usage over widget tree widgets, and
also simplifies use.

<p>This widget was designed for use in file manager type programs, so an
optional pixmap is available for displaying to the left of the text item.  The
pixmap has an open and closed state, and different types of pixmaps are
available for items with and without children.  Currently, pixmaps for
different file types are not available.

<p>The lists are activated by clicking the left mouse button on the Pixmap
of the item, or double clicking ond the name of the item.  The state of the
item is then toggled, and if the item is open, its children are displayed.
Ranges of items can also be toggled by clicking and dragging the left mouse
button over the names of the items you want to highlight.

<p>Because everyone has different tastes in scrollbar asthetics, the ListTree
widget doesn't have any built-in scrolling capability.  It is designed to be
placed in some sort of container widget, and use the container's functions to
scroll around.

<p><hr><h2><a name="reqs">Requirements</a></h2>

<p>The ListTree code requires X11R4 or later and an ANSI C compiler.  The
code may compile on a non-ANSI compiler if it supports new style function
definitions.

<p>The widget is compatible with MOTIF, but does not require it.  It looks
great with the Athena 3D widgets.

<p><hr><h2><a name="history">History</a></h2>

<p>This code was originally developed on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX 4.1
and X11R5.  Version 2.0 was developed on a Linux machine running kernel
1.3.* and XFree86 3.1.2 (X11R6).  It
was also tested on two other machines: a DEC Alpha/AXP running OSF/1 3.0
with X11R5; and an SGI Indigo running IRIX 4.0.5 with X11R4.

<p><hr><h2><a name="note">Author's Note</a></h2>

<p>This widget is supplied as freeware, in the hope that it will be useful for
developers in the X community.  If you do use this widget, I do request that
you include mention of the ListTree widget in the documentation.  Also,
remember to include a copy of the entire copyright and permission notice!
Thanks.

games, and money you love donating to programmers who make your life <b>so</b>
much easier are welcome at <tt>&lt;rwmcm@orion.ae.utexas.edu&gt;</tt>.
