	in MwXFilesel.c and MwXFormat.c.

	and external symbols. This adds "Color Contexts" which

	within Mowitz that calls MwAllocColor or MwQueryColor
	will be rewritten to use color contexts instead.

	Released 0.3.0.

030304	New widget in MwApplicationShell.c is subclassed from
	applicationShellWidgetClass, but has callbacks for
	OffiX and Xdnd drops.

	discovered by James B. Hiller <jhiller@visi.net>.
	Released 0.2.3.

	depends on.
